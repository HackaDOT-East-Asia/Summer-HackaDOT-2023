## Judging Criteria

Eligible submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges selected by the organizer [Section 8.1]. Judges may be third party employees and may change before or during the evaluation period. Judging may take place in one or more rounds with one or more judging panels, at the discretion of the administrator.

We have multi-staged judging criteria and multiple different judging criteria for each stage: 
50% of the prize will be paid out to Top3 teams winner on Demo Day among 10 teams
Top3 teams’ project will be evaluated after 3 month from Demo Day by judges and remaining 50% will be rewarded

### On Demo Day

Entries will be judged on the following weighted criteria, and at the sole and absolute discretion of the judges:

- **Technical Evaluation (30%)**: What is the level of skill or knowledge 
- **Contribution to and advancement of Web3 (30%)**: How does the submission contribute to and advance Web 3.0 as a whole?
- **On stage presentation (20%)**: Is it good enough to provide the judges with a clear understanding of your presentation?
- **Creativity and Uniqueness (10%)**: To what extent is the presentation new and novel with respect to existing technologies?
- **Feasibility (10%)**: How feasible is the idea? How adaptable is it to other integrations? How robust is the business model? **All teams should include milestones of their project**


### After Demo Day
- Project prospect & progress evaluation
    - Judges will evaluate the progress after the Demo Day
    - All top3 teams must continuously contribute to the project and have reached the next milestone that they’ve presented on Demo Day

The judges' scores will determine the eventual winners of the corresponding prizes. The Participant(s) who are eligible for an Award, and whose Submissions receive the highest overall scores based on the applicable Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of that Award.

**Tie Breaker**. For each of the Awards listed below, if two or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score on the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the highest scoring Submission. If a tie remains, this process will be repeated, as necessary, by comparing the scores of the tied submissions on the next applicable criterion. If two or more submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the judging panel will vote on the tied submissions.

## Prize

All prize will be given as **DOT**. Be note that price of token is volatile. 

|  Prize  | DOT Amount |  
|:----------|:-------------:|
| First Prize(x1) |  2000 DOT | 
| Second Prize(x1) | 1500 DOT | 
| Third Prize(x1) | 1000 DOT | 
| TOP4 10 Finalists (x7) | Remainders |

*Important Notes*
- 60% Payout on Demo Day + 40% through an Interview in 90 days. In 90 days, judges will vote on TOP3 projects, whether they are continuously contributing to the project and have reached the next milestone that they’ve presented on **Demo Day**.

## Challenge Topics

> Each challenge topic is suggested by the mentor respectively. Once the applicants choose a topic, the suggestor of the topic becomes the mentor.

- **[Topic 1: Open Track - Build A Parachain (Mentor: Parity Tech)](https://github.com/HackaDOT-East-Asia/Summer-HackaDOT-2023/tree/main/topics/topic1-parity)**

    In this category, we hope that you will be creative and 1) build the custom chain that you think is most useful to other builders of the Substrate ecosystem! (You may find all live-parachains from Parachain Info or Polkadot Open Stack) 2) build a cross-chain dApp using at least three SDK/Tools to make it interoperable among live-parachains. 
    
- **[Topic 2: Build A DApp with ink! Contract (Mentor: Astar)](https://github.com/HackaDOT-East-Asia/Summer-HackaDOT-2023/tree/main/topics/topic2-astar)**

    In this category, we want you to push the limits of what’s possible. Be creative, break things, make us laugh, make us cry. Test suites, visualizations, Wasm interoperability, and everything in between qualifies for this category. Shock us with your brilliance.
    
- **[Topic 3: Build a Connected Contract DApp (Mentor: Moonbeam)](https://github.com/HackaDOT-East-Asia/Summer-HackaDOT-2023/tree/main/topics/topic3-moonbeam)**

    Build a connected contract/cross-dapp using Moonbeam and any GMP protocol. Moonbeam is the best place to build a cross-chain / connected contract thanks to its extensive interoperability. Moonbeam’s interoperability within Polkadot is enabled by Polkadot's native GMP, called XCM.
    
- **[Topic 4: Use JS to Build NFT Games (Mentor: Unique Network)](https://github.com/HackaDOT-East-Asia/Summer-HackaDOT-2023/tree/main/topics/topic4-unique)**
    
    This challenge empowers web2, JS and mobile developers to build games within the Polkadot ecosystem without blockchain knowledge. They can use all advanced NFT features in their applications - Nesting , sponsoring, scheduling, Re-fungibility and more.
    
- **[Topic 5: Use Phat Contract to Build DeFi DApp (Mentor: Phala Network)](https://github.com/HackaDOT-East-Asia/Summer-HackaDOT-2023/tree/main/topics/topic5-phala)**
    
    By organizing a decentralized network of computation nodes around the world, it offers high-performance services without relying on any cloud vendor. Phala workers run the programs in Secure Enclaves, a privacy technology already embedded into modern processors, enabling versatile and confidential execution. Together, this creates the infrastructure for a powerful, secure, and scalable trustless computing cloud.

- **[Topic 6: Support asymmetric encryption/decryption feature (Mentor: SubWallet)](https://github.com/HackaDOT-East-Asia/Summer-HackaDOT-2023/tree/main/topics/topic6-subwallet)**

    Support asymmetric encryption/decryption feature
